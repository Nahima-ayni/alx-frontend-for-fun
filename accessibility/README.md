# Web Accessibility Overview

## ARIAâ€™s Main Purpose

**ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** is a set of attributes that make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. ARIA provides additional information to assistive technologies when standard HTML elements are not sufficient. Its main purposes include:

- **Enhancing Accessibility:** ARIA helps make dynamic content and advanced user interface controls accessible to users with disabilities.
- **Improving Screen Reader Experience:** ARIA roles and properties provide semantic information that helps screen readers interpret and interact with content correctly.
- **Supporting Dynamic Content:** ARIA helps ensure that dynamic content updates (like AJAX) are communicated effectively to users who rely on assistive technologies.

## WCAG Conformance Levels

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a framework for making web content accessible. The guidelines are categorized into three conformance levels:

- **Level A (Minimum Accessibility):** Contains the most basic web accessibility features. Meeting this level is essential but not sufficient for full accessibility.
  - **Example:** Providing text alternatives for non-text content (e.g., images).
  
- **Level AA (Medium Accessibility):** Addresses more significant and common barriers to accessibility. Conformance at this level is typically required for comprehensive accessibility.
  - **Example:** Ensuring sufficient color contrast between text and background.
  
- **Level AAA (Highest Accessibility):** Contains the most complex and challenging criteria to meet. While it is the highest level of accessibility, achieving conformance to this level is often not feasible for all content.
  - **Example:** Providing sign language interpretation for all audio content.

## The Importance of Web Accessibility

Web accessibility is crucial for several reasons:

- **Inclusivity:** Ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can access and interact with web content.
- **Legal Compliance:** Many countries have legal requirements for web accessibility, and non-compliance can lead to legal consequences.
- **Improved User Experience:** Enhances the overall user experience by making websites easier to navigate and understand.
- **Broader Reach:** Expands the audience by including people with disabilities, potentially increasing user engagement and market reach.

## Tools to Use for Web Accessibility

Several tools can help test and improve web accessibility:

- **WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool):** An online tool for evaluating accessibility issues in web content. [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)
- **AXE:** A browser extension for automated accessibility testing and reporting. [AXE](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- **Lighthouse:** A tool integrated with Chrome DevTools for auditing web accessibility and performance. [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
- **NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access):** A free screen reader for Windows that helps test how content is read by screen readers. [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/)
- **VoiceOver:** A built-in screen reader for macOS and iOS devices, useful for testing accessibility on Apple platforms. [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/)

By utilizing ARIA, adhering to WCAG guidelines, understanding the importance of accessibility, and using the right tools, you can ensure that your web content is accessible and inclusive to all users.
